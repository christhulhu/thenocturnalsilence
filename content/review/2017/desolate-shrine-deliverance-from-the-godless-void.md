Oh, this is a vile album. It is simply hopeless, baneful and nasty. It is not a record for those looking for beauty. But for those whose black heart find beauty in darkness. "Deliverance From The Godless Void" challenges the listener. With almost an hour of running time, it is an intense and demanding record. You may not listen to it as background music as you won't understand the message this incredible piece of darkness delivers. You need to pay attention towards every single second. And this might be a challenge due to this massive wall of impressions _Desolate Shrine_ offer on their fourth album.

While most of the over 50 minutes of "Deliverance From The Godless Void" tend to act in an nightmarish mid-tempo, lurk from the the very dark corner of your mind, there are many moments, where _Desolate Shrine_ emerge into furious and blazing blastbeats, destroying every single bit of hope. In some other moments, they take their time to create nightmarish walls of sound, creating abysmal soundscapes and dragging the audience deeper and deeper into their dismal grey world.  In this aspect, the cover artwork just gives an excellent insight into the bleak and dreary vision this album creates and maintains over its overall running time.

Well hidden there are little hints of light and hope. As there might be one slight moment in "The Graeae", during the instrumental interlude. Or when "... Of Hell" exchanges brutal protesting moments with more calm and discreet ones. But most of the time _Desolate Shrine_ serve their very dark vision of extreme music. It emancipates from those typical genre borders, escapes death, black or doom metal. It is forward thinking and partly looks behind all borders, emerges towards post-death metal, to dimensions Ulcerate, Ulsect, Beyond Terror, Beyond Grace or Inter Arma already have passed. But as all of them, "Deliverance From The Godless Void" evolved far beyond the current state of extreme music and creates a part of a bigger, more baneful entity.

As all of this might foreshadow, there are little catchy riffs and moments on this album. Although "Demonic Evocation Prayer" or "The Waters Of Man" offer some slight moments of intoxicating harmonies, most of "Deliverance From The Goddless Void" is pure evil and dark atmosphere. Nevertheless there are many enjoyable moments - as far as you can see the beauty in the dissonance, the darkness, the baneful and nightmarish. But once you can see the discomforting image _Desolate Shrine_ created with this album, it will swallow you, just like "Pickman's Model" did with his reader.
