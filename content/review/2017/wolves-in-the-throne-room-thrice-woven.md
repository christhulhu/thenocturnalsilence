I think _Wolves In The Throne Room_ do not need any further introduction. They were one of the early bands, next to Weakling or Alcest, that embossed the term "post-black metal". Since their first album "Diadem Of The 12 Stars" they have their solid fan base and grew in both popularity and reputation within the scene. But their last record "Celestite" did not quiet match most expectations. To much Ambient sound and too little black metal. But now there is "Thrice Woven" and _WITTR_ continue were they stopped on "Celestial Lineage".

With five songs over more than 42 minutes they keep up their style that became famous under the moniker of "cascadian black metal" and deliver 42 minutes of high qualitity, outstanding black metal. Sublime in every second, sometimes more melancholic, occasionally harsh and direct yet mostly atmospheric. And even if there are some rude breaks, interupting the songs at several points, _WITTR_ manage to keep their songs fluent and coherent.

The opening "Born From Th Serpent's Eye" may be one of the best examples to showcase the versatile style of "Thrice Woven" best. It starts with some chinkings before exploding in majestic black metal. It becomes faster and flows into a dreamful downtempo passage before taking several turns and a final dissolution into a calm part, combined with female chorals. Afterwards it has some post-rock moments as well as a climax into escapism.

The more relaxed part of this track as well as the interlude "Mother Owl, Father Ocean" remind me a little bit of Myrkur, which adds a refreshing new flavour to _WITTR_ on "Thrice Woven". Same for the clean part in "The Old Ones Are With Us" that catches up the introductional sample and has some reminiscence to Killing Joke. Or the synthie-elements in "Fire Roar In The Place Of The Moon".

All together _Wolves In The Throne Room_ take their trademark elements of majestic, distant black metal and enrich them with interesting new ideas and turns. Repetitive and reduced riffs create a great atmosphere, drag the audience out of this world. Those repetitions do not even get boring during their excecution but underline their attitude of escapism and transcendence.

Combined with their outstanding ability of the band to form catching harmonies within those iterative moments and offer interesting turns in their songs, "Thrice Woven" is again a great milestone in "cascadian black metal" as in black metal in general.
