Frankly the music of *Fvneral Fvkk* was quite a surprise to me. Hearing this name I thought more of some rancid death metal in the vein of Graveyard Ghoul, Repuked and so on. Even the cast might have pointed me into a similar assumption: *Fvneral Fvkk* are all members from Ophis except for drummer Steffen, completed by Niko from FÃ¤ulnis. Some guys from a doom/death metal band and a guy from a blackdoompunk band join to have some fun. But in the end *Fvneral Fvkk* plays epic doom metal. With heavy music and gentle vocals.

Although "Erection In The House Of God" has some morbid harmonies on the guitars, it rapidly turns into bewitching melancholic riffs. When the vocals set in the beautiful sadness completes. At least in the musical aspect of "Lecherous Liturgies". The lyrical concept deals with sexual religious themes. That sounds somehow contrary to the fragile and atmospheric music, but fits very well in a cynical way.

"Underneath The Phelonion" continues with heavy instrumentation and lovely melodies for the vocals. There is even a passage where the chants have multiple voices. And in the end the song raises harsher and harsher, ending in a thunderstorm of double bass.

Both tracks showcase an intelligent approach by *Fvneral Fvkk*. Simple but very catchy riffs meet with haunting harmonies and fantastic vocal-lines. And on the other hand there are those "beautiful melodies telling terrible things" which adds a special yet subtile twist to the music.

"Lecherous Liturgies" is released physically on tape by Lycanthropic Chants and as 7" ep vial Bleeding Heart Nihilist Productions. Both feature the two songs "Erection On The House Of God" and "Underneath The Phelonion". For people prefering the digital format, there is the bonus track "Fvcking At Fvnerals" with the download on bandcamp. It is not on the same level like the other two songs, more slimy, raw and direct. With its more simplified harmonies and structur it seems like an earlier product of *Fvneral Fvkk*, playing with some feedback on guitar as well as with effects on the vocals. It is a nice bonus, but the other two numbers are more interesting and make me looking forward to the future releases of the band.
