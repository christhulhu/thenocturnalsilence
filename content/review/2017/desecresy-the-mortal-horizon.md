Picasso had his "blue period", creating melancholic figure paintings. After two albums with a different color-scheme _Desecresy_ return to this analogy that came to my mind with their second record "The Doom Skeptron". Again, there is this omnipresent bale. Both within the music and on the cover artwork. Again there is this image of a skull, reminding the beholder of ever lurking death. And again _Desecresy_ present themself as an independent doom-death metal band with their very own trademark sound. This time maybe with their best output so far.

After "Stoic Death" vocalist Jarno Nurmi left the band, leaving Tommi Grönqvist handling everything by himself. As a result the sound became darker, the vocals and guitars went deeper than ever before.

While _Desecresy_ never made music for the masses, "The Mortal Horizon" got even more special. Still it has those very unique harmonies. Those haunting melodies are eerie, morbid and somehow melancholic; sometimes pushing and full of energy. But in very rare moments calm, almost in the background. They create a ghostly, bleak atmosphere.

Then there is still this crude approach by Grönqvist. The songs are minimalistic, raw, archaic. There are some moments where the harsh uptempo passages are very close to bestial / war metal. The brutal blastbeats in "Excavation" even remind me of early grindcore. But "The Mortal Horizon" is not about stupid thrashing. Too many passages take advantage of pushing midtempo, incorporating Bolt Thrower-like doublebass and driving riffing.
But it isn't even about this stoic groove. It is only another well placed ingredient.

Most of the time there is this ritualistic touch to the songs. Many stop'n go moments, reduced drums and obscure rhythms. Some beats might sound if Tommi isn't able to play drums better. Maybe he isn't, as some passages are really rumbling. But there are some odd breaks and patterns that seem to be well calculated. At least they create this dark and unique vibe that makes _Desecresy_ outstanding.

"The Mortal Horizon" is not a beautiful album. It is harsh, it is minimalistic, it is raw, it is rumbling. There are no outstanding hits. But it has this baneful atmosphere, created by haunting melodies, polyphone harmonies and ritualistic percussions. It is dark, deep and vile. It is very unique doom-death metal aside of any trends or conventions. But with a very own character.
