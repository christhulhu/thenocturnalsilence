## TheNocturnalSilence.de
TheNocturnalSilence.de is a webzine dedicated to dark, gloomy and atmospheric music aside from any genre-limitations. But since this website represents my personal musical taste most reviews will deal about Death Metal, Black Metal, Doom, Post-Rock, Hardcore etc.

And with this said: All reviews are just my very own opinion. I write because I have an obsession with music. So to be honest: I will not answer any review requests. If I did the stuff you might send to me I will maybe write an review. Otherwise don't bother me with questions about a review or even interview.
