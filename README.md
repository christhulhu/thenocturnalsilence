# TheNocturnalSilence.de - Backup

This repository is the backup of the deceased webzine theNocturnalSilence.de. The domain is no longer valid. And at this place the content should be conserved.

You may feel free to browse through the archives here, read the texts. Or to clone this repository and build the site for more eye-candy and visual pleasure.

## Building

Just check this repo out, change into its root directory and build with [Hugo](https://hugo.io).

## Directories
- content: all the content once was published on theNocturnalSilence.de
- resources: -
- static: all images for the design and the texts
- themes: two custom themes I wrote for this zine
- wordpress: a dump of the old CMS I used for this magazine. Plus a converter to migrate the data from xml to markdown-files
